    <div class="right-text">Meanwhile, poor Nemo is struggling to meet the princess and the people of mushroom land.
        He misses her warmth and her love! He sees a shoal of fishes swimming together. Nemo tries to take their help 
        and find a way out. Fortunately he meets dory -his long lost friend. When they were in a conversation nemo finds
        that dory was also lost in the ocean by the cursed well. Dory says that she knows a map which will lead to a magical
        canal that connects with the princessâ€™ palace.   
        Help dory and nemo to find the map.

        the words in the map are jumbled, to continue the journey arrange them.
        Here are some words translated from an artificial language.
        granamelke means big tree
        pinimelke means little tree
        melkehoon means tree house
        Which word could mean "big house"?
        Give the reason 
        <br>
        <br>
        While moving towards , they have to find the speed to move their submarine ,  
        The ratio of time taken for you to  cover (x + 4) km in upstream to that of time taken to cover (x + 20) km in still water is 4: 5. If the ratio of speed t in downstream to that of stream is 5: 1 and the sum of time taken  to cover (x - 5) km in upstream to that in downstream is 8 hours then find the speed  in downstream?

        Kudos !  voyage towards the magical canal begins!
